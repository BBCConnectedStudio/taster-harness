Taster Harness
==============

The Taster harness exists to allow pilot makers to check how their pilot behaves in an IFrame without having
to rely on the Taster team creating a preview link in the full CMS. It implements the core of the hooks
between the pilots and allows you to try that in a stripped back environment.

For more information on the integration hooks please see: https://github.com/BBCConnectedStudio/documentation

For devs: to create a distributable version of this harness, simply run `make` and then create a new release in GitHub
